## Usage:
We wanted to make an app that gave mixologists, bartenders, and cocktail lovers everywhere access to hundreds of fun and unique drink recipes so that they can try new drinks and impress imbibing patrons my making any drink they could ever be requested.  

With Cocktail Code the user can also save any drink from our database into their favorites for quick and easy reference and from any device with just their log in credentials.
